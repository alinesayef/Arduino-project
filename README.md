# Description
The aim of this project was to design a system where an LM35 digital thermometer outputs temperature readings to the Arduino and should the temperature exceed 20 degrees the fan turns on. When the temperature is below 20 degree, only the green LED illuminates. When the temperature is above 20 degrees and below 35 degrees the fan turns on at 50% speed and the white LED illuminates. When the temperature is at or above 35 degrees the fan reaches 100% speed and the yellow LED illuminates.

# Instructions
The Arduino IDE must be installed on your computer to run the .ino file, this can be downloaded from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.
To make modifications to the Fritzing .fzz file, you will need to donwload the Frtizing application from https://fritzing.org/.
